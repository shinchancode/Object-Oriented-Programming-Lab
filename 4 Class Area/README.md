## [Assignment-4 : Class Area](https://github.com/shinchancode/Object-Oriented-Programming-Lab/tree/main/4%20Class%20Area)

**[4] Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of shape. Derive two classes: triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for given case study.**
